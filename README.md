The Gamma is a simple JavaScript library that lets anyone create transparent and open data 
visualizations that are linked to the original source of data and encourages the reader to 
explore data further and find more interesting facts in the data source.

The Gamma library implements a simple scripting language with spreadsheet-inspired tooling 
that runs in the browser and lets users perform simple data aggregation and exploration. The
JavaScript package lets you run scripts written in The Gamma script and it provides a rich 
web-based editor that you can embed on your site to let anyone write and modify The Gamma
visualizations. To see it live, [check out The Gamma sample page](http://thegamma-sample-web.azurewebsites.net/)
or a more elaborate [Visualization of Olympic medals](http://rio2016.thegamma.net/). For more
