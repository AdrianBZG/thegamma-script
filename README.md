The Gamma is a simple JavaScript library that lets anyone create transparent and open data 
visualizations that are linked to the original data source and encourage the reader to 
further explore data and find interesting facts on their own.

The Gamma implements a scripting language with spreadsheet-inspired tooling 
that runs in the browser and lets users perform simple data aggregation and exploration. 
The package lets you run The Gamma scripts and provides a rich web-based editor that 
you can embed on your site.
